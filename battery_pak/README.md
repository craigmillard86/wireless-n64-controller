## Battery Pak
This was designed with FreeCAD version 0.19.

The battery pak assembly used in this project is made up of three pieces:

1. Terminal block - this is the small piece that stays in the pak-port of the controller

2. Pak rounded side

3. Pak square side - this side has a cutout for the micro USB charging port, charging circuitry, wiring, and terminals; it snaps together with the rounded side

The pak itself contains a lithium polymer battery, charging circuitry, and battery terminals.
